      <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations
        are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start
        of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting);
        many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of
        the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities,
        including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).

        The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade schedule
        and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
        Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large
        parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals
        for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the
        Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Clubâ€”a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws
        into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic
        "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each
        year.

        While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate in the
        Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side
        of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place
        downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day
        traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>

      <p>Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she joined the board
        of the Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004. After the 2005
        levee failures in Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely
        and remained mostly deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a
        blue-ribbon panel convened by then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five
        other New Orleans neighborhoods to be converted into greenspace. In her role as president of the
        association, Cantrell worked with residents and local religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's
        recommendation. She also helped enlist returning Broadmoor residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery
        plan for the neighborhood.

        Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and fellow
        residents formed the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H. Wilson
        school. She served as a founding board member of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community
        development corporation that provided case management and other social services for returning residents. She
        was involved with residents' efforts to reopen Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant
        from the Carnegie Endowment. She created a partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and
        Church of the Annunciation, which provided the neighborhood association with office space and hosted volunteer
        groups. She also formed a partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish,
        Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the Broadmoor Art and Wellness Center.</p>
